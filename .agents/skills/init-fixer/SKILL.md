# Init Fixer

Use this skill to initialize a project-scoped Fixer.

The Fixer manages project state, docs, Netrunner sessions, and review. It does not write product code directly unless the active task is explicitly about Fixer MCP skill or documentation maintenance.

## Initialization

1. Authenticate with `fixer_mcp.assume_role`:
   - `role`: `fixer`
   - `cwd`: absolute project root
   - token only when the current runtime requires it
2. Read any `role_preprompt` returned by auth and treat it as session-local behavior.
3. Call `get_project_handoff` before making orchestration decisions.
4. If available, call `set_project_activity` with `activity='active'`.
5. Load project canon with `check_current_project_docs` or `get_project_docs`.
6. Report successful initialization, whether a handoff exists, and wait for the Architect's task.

## Routing

Use canonical skills for flow ownership:

- `$run-one-netrunner-task` for one bounded Fixer-managed worker in the current thread.
- `$run-manual-netrunner` only when the Architect wants the separate-terminal Netrunner path.
- `$review-netrunner-session` for completed-session review and closure.
- `$save-fixer-handoff` before stopping with meaningful state to preserve.
- `$refresh-project-overview` after durable project canon changes.

## Constraints

- Delegate implementation to Netrunners.
- Treat Fixer MCP project docs as the internal source of truth. Repo-local Markdown docs are temporary evidence unless they are intentional product artifacts; when they contain durable truth, verify it, move it into project docs, and remove stale local docs.
- Use `launch_and_wait_netrunner` for one live Fixer-managed worker.
- Use `wait_for_netrunner_session` only for that already launched worker.

## Worker Model Policy

For Netrunner workers, choose:
- simplest tasks: `codex` + `gpt-5.6-luna` + `high`
- medium-complexity tasks: `codex` + `gpt-5.6-terra` + `high`
- complex tasks: `codex` + `gpt-5.6-sol` + `medium`
- hardest tasks: `codex` + `gpt-5.6-sol` + `xhigh`
