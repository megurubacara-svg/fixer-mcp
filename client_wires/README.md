# Client Wires

Canonical client launch wires for Fixer MCP live in this directory.

These wires are the bridge between durable orchestration state in `fixer_mcp` and actual worker execution in Codex-backed sessions. They are what turns stored sessions, attached docs, MCP selections, and review rules into real Fixer, Netrunner, and Overseer runs.

## Common Path

For a new operator, the usual first commands are:

```bash
python3 client_wires/fixer_wire.py --wire-info
python3 client_wires/fixer_wire.py --role fixer
```

No sibling `mcp_servers/codex_pro_app` checkout is required; the launcher uses
the repo-vendored `client_wires.codex_compat` package.

## Why These Wires Matter

This directory is more than a launch convenience layer. It is where the repo converts the control-plane model into disciplined execution:
- role-aware startup for Fixer, Netrunner, and Overseer
- session-aware resume flows
- deterministic MCP assignment injection
- explicit autonomous worker dispatch and wake-up behavior
- backend-aware launch metadata for `codex` and `droid`

## Flow Map

- `Fixer-managed worker flow`: every autonomous Netrunner is created, launched, awaited, and cleaned up through Fixer MCP wave tools, including one-worker waves.
- `manual separate-terminal`: use `$run-manual-netrunner` when the Architect wants to launch or resume the Netrunner personally in another terminal.
- `review and closure`: use `$review-netrunner-session` when a completed session needs Fixer review, acceptance, rejection, or lifecycle closure.

## Netrunner Worker Model Policy

Choose the Netrunner worker configuration by task complexity:

- simplest tasks: `codex` + `gpt-5.6-luna` + `high`
- medium-complexity tasks: `codex` + `gpt-5.6-terra` + `high`
- complex tasks: `codex` + `gpt-5.6-sol` + `medium`
- hardest tasks: `codex` + `gpt-5.6-sol` + `xhigh`

## Fixer Wire

- Entrypoint: `client_wires/fixer_wire.py`
- Purpose: launch role flows for `fixer`, `netrunner`, and `overseer`.
- Runtime source: uses the vendored `client_wires.codex_compat` launcher helpers.
- Repo-local MCP additions for this project should live in the root `mcp_config.json` so the base launcher path discovers them automatically; `client_wires/fixer_wire.py` also overlays optional root `webMCP.toml` entries after that base discovery pass for wire-specific additions.
- Manual Netrunner launch now injects `$run-manual-netrunner` with a preselected session and MCP set, then stops after the initialization checklist unless the Architect explicitly pre-approved immediate execution.
- Netrunner UX:
  - Uses keyboard-friendly interactive selectors (arrow keys + enter).
  - Enforces two dialogs in sequence (session picker, then MCP checklist).
  - Session picker shows only `in_progress` by default; `+` toggles archived statuses.
  - MCP checklist hides `fixer_mcp` (forced always-on) and persists manual overrides back to `fixer.db`.
- MVP scaffold UX:
  - `fixer --scaffold-mvp <project_slug>` creates a fresh Serverpod + Flutter + `llm_pipeline` starter from any cwd.
  - Optional `--scaffold-target-dir <parent_dir>` chooses where the new project root is created.
  - The scaffold runs before Codex bootstrap or project registration checks, so it also works for brand-new projects.
  - Plain `fixer` now exposes `MVP Scaffold` in the first menu, then asks for project name, target directory, and `dry-run` vs real create mode.
- Wave-only autonomous Fixer loop:
  - `python3 client_wires/fixer_autonomous.py register-fixer --cwd <project_root>` stores the active Fixer resume thread for later autonomous wake-ups.
  - `register-fixer` resolves the Fixer Codex session in this order: explicit `--fixer-session-id`, then `CODEX_THREAD_ID` / `CODEX_SESSION_ID` from the current shell, then history-based auto-detection.
  - `create_netrunner_wave`, `launch_netrunner_wave`, `wait_for_netrunner_wave`, and `cleanup_netrunner_wave` are the only autonomous worker lifecycle.
  - `wait_for_netrunner_wave.timeout_seconds` defaults to 300 seconds; every explicit value must be between 300 and 21600 seconds inclusive. Use 300 seconds for ordinary polling, raise it up to 21600 for an expected very heavy or long-running Netrunner, and never exceed 21600.
  - `launch_netrunner_wave.worker_configs` assigns per-session backend/model/reasoning overrides while top-level launch fields remain defaults.
  - Codex Fixer launches mount a second `fixer_netrunner_gate` MCP namespace whose server-level surface contains only `launch_netrunner_wave` and `wait_for_netrunner_wave`. The primary `fixer_mcp` copy hides those duplicates while preserving the full Fixer tool catalog through Code Mode.
  - The gate process auto-authenticates only when it is simultaneously locked to `fixer`, bound to a registered project CWD, explicitly opted into auto-auth, and started with the `netrunner_gate` tool profile. Ordinary Fixer MCP processes retain normal `assume_role` authentication.
  - The repo-managed wire forces the attached `fixer_mcp` server timeout floor to `21600s`, matching long wave waits.
  - Claude Code launch materialization writes `.mcp.json` per-server `timeout` in milliseconds, using `per_tool_timeout_ms` first and otherwise converting the wire's second-based timeout fields.
  - Serial launch-and-wait tools and the `fixer_autonomous.py launch-netrunner` CLI command are retired and must not be revived or replaced by provider CLI shell-outs.
  - Fresh role launches set `FIXER_MCP_LOCKED_ROLE` on the forced `fixer_mcp` server: `overseer` for Overseer, `fixer` for Fixer, and `netrunner` for Netrunner.
  - Internal `launch-wave-worker` and `launch-wave-reviewer` commands are wave-bound implementation details; the reviewer command validates the exact `parallel-wave-review:<wave_id>` session marker.
  - Routine operator Telegram updates now go through `fixer_mcp.send_operator_telegram_notification` with project-bound context; `telegram_notify` is no longer part of the normal Fixer/Netrunner MCP surface for this workflow.
  - Older broken tests in scope are part of the worker obligation when they block the change; Ghost Run must not degrade into code-only delivery.
  - When a final tester worker reports bugs, the autonomous review handoff is expected to spawn repair Netrunner sessions from those findings before Ghost Run concludes.
  - Wave workers do not wake the Fixer individually; `wait_for_netrunner_wave` owns completion and reviewer progression.
- Fixer UX:
  - Shows a role-specific pre-screen: `Start new Fixer` or `Resume existing Fixer`.
  - Resume picker lists prior Fixer Codex sessions with `started` and `updated` timestamps.
  - No MCP selection UI is shown for Fixer; `fixer_mcp` remains forced-attached.
  - Fixer launch uses `--sandbox danger-full-access` to preserve codex-pro style cross-cwd filesystem behavior.
- Fresh Fixer/Overseer launches ensure the current cwd is registered in the launcher DB before role startup.
  - Unknown cwd onboarding happens through the launcher path, so normal role startup does not require a manual Overseer `register_project` call first.
- Overseer UX:
  - Overseer launch also defaults to `--sandbox danger-full-access` unless an explicit sandbox flag is passed through.
- Session resume:
  - Tracks `codex` session IDs in `session_codex_link`.
  - Selecting an archived session (`review`/`completed`) auto-resumes `codex` by stored session ID.
- Session lifecycle closure: Fixer/Overseer now finalize reviewed work via `set_session_status` (typically `review` -> `completed`), with optional rollback to `pending`/`in_progress` when rework is needed.
- Netrunner supports non-interactive verification flags:
  - `--netrunner-session-id <id>`
  - `--netrunner-mcp <name[,name...]>` (repeatable)
  - `--dry-run` (prints resolved launch command without running Codex)

## Compatibility Bridge

Legacy alias target remains supported:

- `python3 ../mcp_servers/fixer.py`

That legacy script delegates into this repo-local entrypoint, so execution passes through `client_wires/fixer_wire.py`.
